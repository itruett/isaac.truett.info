	<h3>If at first you don't succeed</h3>
	<p>Back at the beginning of the year I posted on Google+ about <a href="https://plus.google.com/+IsaacTruett/posts/9xCcV1qSumF">my first attempt at soldering in a very long time</a>. Since Google+ is going away, I figure I should start posting updates somewhere else.</p>
	<!--excerpt-->
	<p>This is what it looked like on the first try:</p>
	<ol class="gallery"><li><img src={% link images/soldering-before1.jpg %} alt='' ></li><li><img src={% link images/soldering-before2.jpg %} alt='' ></li></ol>
	<p>I'll probably re-post some of my Google+ take-out here later, but for now you can go read about the first attempt at the previous link.</p>
	<p>Anyway, after some encouragement and advice from Kiki Jewell and Adam Liss, here is the same piece on my second attempt:</p>
	<ol class="gallery"><li><img src={% link images/soldering-after1.jpg %} alt='' ></li><li><img src={% link images/soldering-after2.jpg %} alt='' ></li></ol>
	<p>I still have trouble getting the pins heated to the point where solder will melt onto them. I end up melting some solder onto the tip of the iron and then dabbing a drop onto each pin. The result <em>works</em>, which is good enough for me, for now. Hopefully I will get time to practice on more electronics projects and my technique will improve.</p>
