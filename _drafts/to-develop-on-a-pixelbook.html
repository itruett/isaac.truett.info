	<p>Would you like a light-weight, powerful development machine that starts up &ndash; and updates &ndash; in a flash? I did. I've been using Chromebooks since the original CR-48, and while I loved the simplicity and ease of using the internet on one, I still needed a traditional laptop to do software development. Until now.</p>
	<p>With the announcement of Linux application support at Google I/O this year, the promise of having a fully-functional development environment on a Chromebook (without Developer Mode) seemed in reach. That, coming on the heels of Android app support, makes for a rich library of software available on the Chrome OS platform. I decided to take the plunge, and I have been working on this website completely on my new Pixelbook for the last few days.</p>
	<p>Let's take a look at what I did to start developing a Jekyll website on Chrome OS.</p>

				<p>The first thing to do is turn on Linux support</p>
				<ol>
					 	<li>Go to chrome://settings/?search=linux</li>
						<li>Click "Turn on"</li>
						<li>In the dialog, click "Install" (this took a few minutes)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If the option isn't available under settings, you might need to enable Crostini under chrome://flags:</p>

				<p>When the installation finishes, you should have a Linux terminal application available:</p>

		<dt><h3>Start up a webserver</h3></dt>
		<dd>
			<details>
				<summary>How</summary>
				<p>Now we should be able to serve our website using Jekyll. But first, we need figure out what IP address to listen to.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
ip address
{% endhighlight %}
				<p>Look for the address that starts "inet 100.115.92." and use that IP address as an argument to the serve command:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
bundle exec jekyll serve --host=100.115.92.###
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>Starting up the Jekyll web server was easy, but the website wasn't coming up in my browser at <code>localhost:4000</code> like it usually does. I found that the Linux container I was running Jekyll in now was complicating things. With a little work I managed to get a series of commands that would find the correct IP address to bind to, and then I could load that in Chrome.</p>
