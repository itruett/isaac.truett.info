	<h3>Leadership is Infrastructure for Organizations</h3>
	<p>Good infrastructure is invisible. You don't think about power
		lines or sewer lines most days unless there's a problem. You don't say
		"gosh, the power company did a really good job keeping the lights on
		yesterday." A good leader in an organization is like that. You know
		who's in charge, but when things are going well and the leaders are
		doing their jobs correctly, it's not readily apparent. This is not to
		say that they are &mdash; or appear to be &mdash; doing nothing.
		Instead, the leader's most effective actions may be behind the scenes,
		less obvious to the people further away in the organization.</p>

	<h3>The Old Ways Are No Longer Enough</h3>
	<p>More important to know the right questions to ask, not just to have all of the answers.</p>
	<p>If good leadership doesn't catch attention, how do you recognize
		it? How do you find the role models that serve as examples for good
		leadership?</p>
	<p>Look for people who help others find answers instead of always giving them.</p>
	<h3>Being Invisible</h3>
	<blockquote><pre>To lead people, walk beside them &hellip;
As for the best leaders, the people do not notice their existence.
The next best, the people honor and praise.
The next, the people fear; and the next, the people hate &hellip;
When the best leader's work is done the people say,
We did it ourselves!
