	<p><em>My opinionated guide to using git for version control.</em></p>
	<h3>Principles</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Developers are stewards of history</strong>
			<ul><li>Keep the log clean; protect its integrity</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>What goes on Master, stays on Master</strong>
			<ul><li>Never force push</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Tags are like photographs; snapshots of a moment in time</strong>
			<ul><li>Tag things you want to remember and remove them from HEAD &ndash; don’t leave them there “just in case” &ndash; it’ll last longer</li></ul>
		<li><strong>Branches are short and sweet, like a limerick</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>… unless you maintain multiple versions of your product, in which case some of your branches are main-line for those versions</li>
				<li>All other branches: git in, make your changes, and git out</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Rebase is your friend</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>No merge commits</li>
				<li>Fast-forward merging only</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This guide is still a work-in-progress. Check back later for more!</p>

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout master
git pull --rebase

			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>This will make sure that you're on the master branch, that master is up-to-date, and that any stray commits you have lying around in your local repository's master branch are placed on top of the remote version of history, as is Good and Proper in the stewardship of your code's history.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git config --global pull.rebase true
{% endhighlight %}
				<p>This config setting will make rebase the default behavior for <code>pull</code>, in case you forget to add the <code>--rebase</code> flag.</p>

			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>Making changes on a separate branch helps  history stay clean by keeping all of your changes for a specific feature or bugfix together, giving you a place to amend or revert commits without leaving a trace in history, and finally submitting your changes for a review as part of a pull request process.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
git add one/path/at/a/time
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>A quick shortcut to recursively add all of the changes in the current directory is <code>git all .</code>, but, by adding files individually, you have a chance to be thoughtful and make a deliberate decision about whether each file belongs in the commit. It can be tempting to take all of the changes at once, but we often end up touching many files during the development process and making changes that are not required in the final solution. These changes may be good changes to make, but if they aren't required for the current issue you're working on, it's probably best to make a separate commit.</p>

				{% highlight bash %}git diff --cached{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p><code>diff</code> with the <code>--cached</code> will show you all of your staged (added), but not yet committed, changes. This is a good opportunity to review what you've done, and make sure that each line that changed is correct and appropriate to be committed at this time.</p>

				<code>[issue-123] Adds a third solo to correct for insufficient cowbell</code>
