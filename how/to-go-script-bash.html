	<p>This guide will show you how to add <a href=https://github.com/mbland/go-script-bash>go-bash-script</a> to your project. Mike's documentation is already a great place to start. Hopefully this example is a useful addition.</p>

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbland/go-script-bash/master/go-template >./go
$ chmod ugo+rx ./go
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>The curl command lets us quickly copy a single file out of GitHub, and the chmod command sets the write and execute permissions so we can run the script.</p>

				<p>Edit the <code>go</code> file and change the line that declares <code>GO_SCRIPTS_DIR</code>:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
declare GO_SCRIPTS_DIR=.scripts
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>The scripts feel like configuration/metadata for my project, so I wanted to tuck them into a directory named with a leading dot.</p>

		<dt><h3>Add <code>/.scripts/go-script-bash</code> to <code>.gitignore</code></h3></dt>
		<dd>
			<details>
				<summary>How</summary>
				<p>Edit your <code>.gitignore</code> file (assuming you're using git) to prevent the go-script-bash framework from being added to your repository.</p>
{% highlight gitignore %}
/.scripts/go-script-bash
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>Running the go command for the first time will download the go-script-bash framework from GitHub. You could check that in along with your code, or add it as a submodule as Mike explains in his documentation. I chose to let it download once every time I set up my project on a new computer. I feel that option keeps my repository the cleanest.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>How</summary>
{% highlight bash %}
$ ./go env | bash
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p><code>./go env</code> will print out a command to define the go script as a function that you can use from anywhere in your project. Piping that output into <code>bash</code> runs the command immediately.</p>

		<dt><h3>Create your first go command script</h3></dt>

			<details>
				<summary>How</summary>
				<p>Use the <code>go new</code> command to create a new script file:</p>
				{% highlight bash %}
$ go new --command serve
{% endhighlight %}
				<p>Edit the new file (.scripts/serve) to do something useful:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
#! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# Starts the built-in Jekyll development server

_serve() {
        local IP=$(ip -f inet addr show eth0 | sed -n -e 's/^    inet \(.*\)\/.*$/\1/p')
        bundle exec jekyll serve --host=$IP ${_GO_CMD_ARGV}
}

_serve "$@"
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>My <code>serve</code> command was getting a little unwieldly after I had to start specifying the IP address to bind to (I'll address that more when I get to writing about my experience with developing on a Pixelbook). This command uses <code>sed</code> to parse an IP address from the output of <code>ip</code> and then passes that on to Jekyll. <code>${_GO_CMD_ARGV}</code> lets me pass additional arguments, so I can do something like <code>go serve --drafts</code> to include draft posts when running my website locally.</p>

				<p>Use the <code>go new</code> command to create a new script file:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ go new --command setup
{% endhighlight %}
				<p>Edit the new file (.scripts/setup) to do something useful:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
#! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# Installs ruby, jekyll, bundler, and their dependencies.

_setup() {
        sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-all-dev zlib1g-dev
        sudo gem install jekyll bundler
        bundle install
}

_setup "$@"
{% endhighlight %}
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Why</summary>
				<p>This command should come in handy the next time I have to set up a new workspace for this project. It will install ruby, jekyll, bundler, and all the other dependencies needed to run my website.</p>

	At this point I have some useful scripts that make it easy to do things like set up my project on a new computer, or start up the Jekyll server to preview my website. I'm sure I'll add more since the go-script-bash framework makes it easy to do.
